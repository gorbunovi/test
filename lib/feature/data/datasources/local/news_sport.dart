        diskription: 'For British track and field fans there are few sights more thrilling than Dina Asher-Smith going supersonic. It is not just her speed that rips the breath away, it is the economy of movement and sense of imperious power as she glides clear of a world-class field. No wonder a near sell-out crowd in Birmingham roared as Asher-Smith powered to a British 60m record of 7.03sec in her heat of the World Indoor Tour finals, before leaving world and European champions gasping behind her in winning the final in 7.05.',

        diskription: 'Alabama’s coach, Nate Oats, says he will put an end to Brandon Miller’s pregame introduction in the light of a homicide near the university in January. '
            'This week police alleged in courtroom testimony that Miller brought a gun to former Alabama teammate Darius Miles, who is charged with capital murder in the fatal shooting of Jamea Harris, a young mother. '
            'The week’s details cast a different light on Miller’s regular pregame introduction, in which a Tide staffer gives him a pat down. Oats said the introduction will no longer take place.',

        title: 'Wales show heart and desire but Gatland’s blunt force fall short',
        diskription: 'Whatever else is wrong with Welsh rugby, they’ve never lacked heart. You could hear it in Katherine Jenkins’ singing, which must have shattered windows in Aberystwyth, and feel it in the heat of the fireworks that spiralled into the bright blue sky beyond the open roof. '
            'For all their failings, the Welsh Rugby Union still know how to organise a show at the Principality Stadium. And you could see what it all meant, too, in the faces of those two old friends and teammates, Alun Wyn Jones, 37, and Ken Owens, 36, as they roared the final words of the anthem, their arms wrapped tight around each other’s shoulders.'
            'Jones’ heart is bigger than most, so is Owens’. Between them, they’ve helped keep Welsh rugby alive despite all its problems for well over a decade now, Jones made his debut in 2006, Owens in 2011. Warren Gatland relied on them all through his first stint in charge of his team, you wonder if he’s surprised to find that he still needs them so badly now in his second.',

        title: 'Kyle Sinckler strikes for England to compound Wales’ miserable week',
        diskription: 'Welsh rugby had already endured the roughest week in its history and a first English win in Cardiff since 2017 has duly topped it off. Not that England will care how their neighbours are feeling. This was a dogfight between two desperate teams, both committed to emerging victorious by whatever means available, and a try count of three to one in the visitors’ favour was ultimately the game’s second-most telling statistic. '
            'Just five minutes remained when Ollie Lawrence dived gleefully over in the left corner to seal an outcome that will feel sweetest in the English dressing room. All too often it was a case of England’s defence standing firm against Wales’s mostly blunt attacking efforts in a contest that rarely hit any great heights of subtlety or sophistication. That said, England will see this as another step forward in their journey under Steve Borthwick and one which, on paper at least, keeps them in this season’s title race.',

            'South Australia required four runs from the final six deliveries with five wickets in hand under an adjusted Duckworth-Lewis-Stern target at Hobart’s Blundstone Arena on Saturday night. Enter Coyte, who bowled Annie O’Neil (28 from 20) off ball one before getting South Australia skipper Jemma Barsby (28 from 17) stumped two balls later.',

        diskription: 'Baseball’s new rules designed to improve pace of play are coming fast at everyone, particularly the players. The most dramatic moment of the new pitch clock era arrived on the first full day of spring games. Cal Conley of the Atlanta Braves thought he had won his team’s game against the Boston Red Sox with a two-out, bases-loaded walk-off walk. He took a few steps toward first base with bat in hand when umpire John Libka indicated strike three. Conley wasn’t set in the box as the clock wound under eight seconds. The penalty is an automatic strike.',

        diskription: 'Tkyo blues. Dina Asher-Smith did pretty well, all things considered, to keep it together for the opening minute and seven seconds of a startlingly raw post-race debrief in the bowels of the Olympic Stadium, and fresh from elimination in the semi-final of the 100 metres.'
            ' The past five weeks have, it turns out, been an extraordinary story of cloak and dagger rehab for the fastest British woman ever to take to the track. On 26 June Asher-Smith felt a pop in her hamstring en route to winning the Team GB trials in Manchester in a time of 10.97sec. As she told the gathered journalists in that Tokyo hanger, “You were all looking at the clock, you didn’t know what the story was.”',

        diskription: 'A couple of days out from the second Test, at a drinks reception, the chief executive of New Zealand Cricket, David White, referred to the Basin Reserve as the “spiritual home” of the sport in the country, prompting a few harrumphs from the visiting heads of the country’s major associations. Lighthearted harrumphs, admittedly, they nevertheless spoke of the pride that underpins cricket across New Zealand and the collective drive from the bottom up that has seen the men’s national team go unbeaten at home for five years, while claiming the inaugural World Test Championship title in 2021.',

        title: 'Australia firm T20 World Cup final favourites but wary of South Africa',
        diskription: 'There have not been many times since Australia won the last T20 World Cup at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2020 that the team has looked beatable. Since that memorable win in front of a record crowd, Australia has only lost three T20 internationals - two to New Zealand and one to India via a super over in late 2022. Australia have always been a dominant team, but that win seemed to set them on a course of becoming near-indestructible. There are also not many ways to beat Australia. Opposition teams must feel trapped in a horror movie at times - they manage to take quick early wickets and dismiss the openers cheaply, only to have more batters rise up and take on the game. They smash the frontline fast bowlers out of the match, only for captain Meg Lanning to pull an ace from her never-ending list of bowling options.',

        title: 'Loris Karius knows only too well how one game can change a career',
        diskription: 'Four days after the 2018 Champions League final, Jürgen Klopp got a call from Franz Beckenbauer. Like everyone, the legendary former Germany captain and coach had seen the game in Kyiv, seen Liverpool losing 3-1 to Real Madrid after a pair of blunders by their goalkeeper Loris Karius. And something about it hadn’t quite looked right. After a conversation with a doctor, he picked up the phone to Klopp. “Your goalkeeper had a concussion,” Beckenbauer told Klopp. An armchair diagnosis, for sure, but one that intrigued Klopp enough to make further inquiries. The next day Karius was flown to Boston where he had rigorous tests at the Spaulding Rehabilitation hospital. The concussion assessment consists of a checklist of 30 symptoms, including headache, light sensitivity, loss of memory and nausea. Five days after the biggest game of his life, Karius still had 26 of the 30 clinical signs of concussion.',
